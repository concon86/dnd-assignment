# Questions

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment?

8 hours

## What about this assignment did you find most challenging?

Not often exposed to canvas. Where when we work with React, it is easy to select element, in a canvas, trying to select elements are not as easy. Trying to get an image to upload and move independent of each other

## What about this assignment did you find unclear?

As I really do not know how to individually select elements in a canvas, it was not clear if that was the expected behaviour, so the work around was to create a button toggle to toggle between the selected image. No where in the doc did it say it was not allowed.

## What challenges did you face that you did not expect?

Canvas and the logic of it

## Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?

It may be a bit tougher that I expected, I am used to React with it's virtual dom and it's non DOM manipulation, this all breaks down when using it with a Canvas

## Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.

I used React because that is what I am proficient in. I can useRef to get the DOM element, and useState to manage some of the states that I need to change when interacting with the component
